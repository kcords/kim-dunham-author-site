    "Kimberly is a YA fantasy author and an Aurora Contest finalist. She lives in the rainy Pacific Northwest with her husband and daughter. Previously, she was a social media coordinator for a nonprofit women’s clinic. Today, she balances writing with homeschooling her daughter and working toward completing a degree in English language and literature. When she has a little downtime, which is never, she enjoys forest hikes, collecting houseplants, trying to decorate cakes, gardening, and playing guitar.",
