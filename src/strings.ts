    "I write YA dark forest fantasy. My stories feature darkness because life can be hard. They also feature flawed, ordinary people stumbling through the night on their way to something better\nIn August of 2016, I lost my first baby to a miscarriage. Writing went from something fun I occasionally dabbled in to a necessity to help me process my grief. I had lost something precious, but I knew my Maker walked alongside me in my pain. I wanted to read and write stories about finding hope in darkness, so I picked up an unfinished manuscript I started in high school, dusted it off, and transformed it into a full-length novel. That novel was Betwixt, and it would go on to final in the fantasy category of the Aurora Contest by Realm Makers.",

    "Some of my sweetest memories take place in the forest. I grew up in Northern California, where mountains march along the horizon and temperature soars into triple digits all summer long. Camping with my mom and brother was a significant part of growing up, as was attending various church camps throughout middle and high school. After graduating high school, I worked on staff at a summer camp with rustic cabins and a rickety water slide. I spent every afternoon under the pine trees on the beach, playing guitar and singing with friends. Later, I spent a year living in a tiny mountain town where I met my husband. I worked in a nearly windowless office that was crowded with machine parts. When I got off work, I would jump in my car and go for adventures in the forest\nToday, being in the forest means fond memories and a break from the typical rhythm of everyday life; it also feels like a connection to creation and the Creator. That’s why I write stories featuring dark forests filled with magic, plant lore, romance, and themes of hope and belonging.",

  writingText:
    "I started telling stories in my head the minute I picked up the Little House series in third grade. I went on to write several short stories in middle and high school, including The Kiltman, which features a protagonist who was both a superhero and a public menace, and Princes and Frogs, a sweet allegorical fairytale about faith, love, and dragons masquerading as sheep. Several blogs and a creative writing hiatus later, I participated in my first-ever National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) competition. I learned about plot and structure from Jessica Brody's excellent book, Save The Cat! Writes a Novel, and completed the Foundations of Fiction class through Writing Mastery Academy\nIn the fall of 2023, I returned to school for an English language and literature degree. I entered the League for Innovation Literary Contest by Seattle Colleges and received an honorable mention for my Sci-Fi short story, The Sidewalk. One of my favorite classes was children’s literature, which taught me the value of writing for children with empathy and understanding. In books and stories we - and our children - see ourselves and each other. Through these stories we celebrate our colorful, diverse world crafted by a creative and color-loving Creator who created all people in his image. I aim to represent and honor the beauty and diversity of the natural world and the people who inhabit it through my stories",
