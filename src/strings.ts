    "I write YA dark forest fantasy. My stories feature darkness because life can be hard. Most importantly, my stories feature flawed, ordinary people stumbling through the night on their way to something better.\nIn August of 2016, I lost my first baby to a miscarriage. Suddenly, writing went from something fun I occasionally dabbled in to a necessity. I had lost something precious, but I knew my Maker walked alongside me in my grief. I wanted to read and write stories about finding hope in darkness, so I picked up my unfinished manuscript from high school, dusted it off, and transformed it into a full-length novel. That novel was Betwixt, and it would go on to final in the fantasy category of the Aurora Contest by Realm Makers.",

  forestsText:
    "I grew up in Northern California, the part close to the Oregon border where snow-capped mountains march along the horizon and the temperature soars into triple digits all summer. We had more pine forests than anything there, but on the coast, there were redwoods. I remember driving through Prairie Creek State Park and falling in love with the scenery: a million trickling waterfalls, a muddy road, and treetops disappearing into the fog.\nSome of my sweetest memories take place in the forest. Camping with my mom and brother was a significant part of growing up, as was attending various church camps with forest settings throughout middle and high school. I worked on staff at a tiny summer camp with rustic cabins and a rickety water slide right after I graduated high school; I remember sitting on the beach at the edge of the trees, playing guitar and singing with friends. Later, I spent a year living in a tiny mountain town where I met my husband; I spent most of my time there working in an office crowded with machine parts and barely any windows, but when I got the chance to escape, I would drive around avoiding deer and watching the mist writhe above the trees.\nToday, being in the forest means fond memories and a break from the typical rhythm of everyday life; it also feels like a connection to creation and the Creator. That’s why I write stories featuring dark forests filled with magic, plant lore, puns, romance, and themes of hope and belonging.",

    "I started writing short stories in eighth grade; the first was a fanfiction called Lord of the Sporks, and the second was The Kiltman, featuring a protagonist who was both a superhero and a public menace. I penned more short stories throughout high school, started a blog or two (anyone remember Xanga?), and eventually started my first novel. At some point, I laid the manuscript aside and didn't pick it up again until November 2016 when I participated in my first-ever NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) competition.\nI learned about plot and structure from Jessica Brody's excellent book, Save The Cat! Writes a Novel; later, I completed her Foundations of Fiction class through Writing Mastery Academy. Since then, I’ve attended various workshops and writer’s conferences including the AWP Writer’s Conference, Southwest Washington Writer’s Conference, and Write in the Harbor, all of which taught me invaluable information about the craft of fiction writing. At one of those conferences, Jeff Wheeler, author of the bestselling Kingfountain series, was kind enough to answer my questions about character motivations. Jeff's advice proved to be a game-changer for my novel writing.\nIn the fall of 2023, I returned to school for an English language and literature degree. I entered the League for Innovation Literary Contest by Seattle Colleges and received an honorable mention for my Sci-Fi short story, The Sidewalk. One of my favorite classes to date has been children’s literature with Diana Ma, author of the Daughters of the Dynasty series. Diana’s class taught me the value of writing for children with empathy and understanding. We live in a colorful, diverse world crafted by a creative and color-loving Creator who created all people in his image. Although I will inevitably make mistakes in my writing, I aim to represent the beauty, artistry, and diversity of the natural world and the people that inhabit it in my stories.",
