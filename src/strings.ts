  storiesText: `I write YA dark forest fantasy. My stories feature darkness because life
        can be hard. Most importantly, my stories feature flawed, ordinary
        people stumbling through the night on their way to something better.`,
  forestsHeading: "Why Forests?",
  forestsText: `I grew up in Northern California—the part close to the Oregon border
        where snow-capped mountains march along the horizon and the temperature
        soars into triple digits all summer long. We had more pine forests than
        anything there, but on the coast, there were redwoods. I remember
        driving through Prairie Creek State Park and falling in love with the
        scenery: a million trickling waterfalls, a muddy road, and treetops
        disappearing into the fog.\nSome of my sweetest memories take place in
        the forest. That’s why I write stories featuring dark forests filled
        with magic, plant lore, puns, romance, and themes of hope and belonging.`,
  writingHeading: "Writing Journey",
  writingText: `In eighth grade, I wrote a story called The Kiltman, featuring a
        protagonist who was both a superhero and a public nuisance. Then, during
        my junior year of high school, I started writing a novel—a novel that I
        laid aside for the next 8 years. In August of 2016, I lost my first baby
        to a miscarriage. For the first time, I experienced grief mingled with
        hope—grief because I had lost something precious and hope because I knew
        my Maker walked alongside me in my grief. That fall, I participated in
        my first National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) competition. I dusted
        off my unfinished manuscript from high school, made some revisions, and
        got to work transforming it into a full-length novel. Later, I learned
        about plot and structure by attending a lecture by Jessica Brody,
        reading her excellent book, Save The Cat! Writes a Novel, and completing
        her Foundations of Fiction class through Writing Mastery Academy. I’ve
        attended various workshops and writer’s conferences including the AWP
        Writer’s Conference, Southwest Washington Writer’s Conference, and Write
        in the Harbor. At one of those conferences, I met Jeff Wheeler, author
        of the bestselling Kingfountain series. Jeff was kind enough to answer
        my questions and explain the importance of character motivations, which
        was a game-changer for my novel writing. In the fall of 2023, I decided
        to go back to school. I am currently working toward a degree in English
        language and literature. One of my favorite classes has been children’s
        literature with Diana Ma, author of the Daughters of the Dynasty series
        and The Unbeatable Lily Hong. Diana’s class taught me the value of
        writing with empathy and understanding for kids. We live in a colorful,
        diverse world crafted that way intentionally by a creative and
        color-loving Creator. Although I will inevitably make mistakes, I aim to
        show off the beauty and artistry of the natural world and the people
        that inhabit it in all my stories.\nFinally, I entered my first novel,
        Betwixt, in the Aurora Contest by Realm Makers in late 2023. Betwixt
        advanced to round 2 of the fantasy category and then advanced to the
        final round. At the same time, I entered the League for Innovation
        Literary Contest by Seattle Colleges and received an honorable mention
        for my short story, The Sidewalk.`,
